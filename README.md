# Drone Simulator

3D environment for simulating and controlling virtual quadcopter drones.

features

- Pitch: Forward and Back tilt control of drone.

- Roll: Left and Right tilt control of drone.

- Altitude: Up and down control of drone.

- Gravity: Acceleration downwards due to gravity.

features to be implemented:

- Yaw: left and right yaw control. 

The axes of drone will need to move with the drone.

- PID controller and PID graph visualizer for stable flight and for coordinate click and mission control.

- Multiple drone fleet controller, for operating a number of drones in an airspace.
