# 3d_renderer

3d graphics renderer built from only using pygame and numpy in Python.

This was done to help my understanding of rotation, scale and transformation matrices.

I would like to try and rewrite this using c++ and openGL.

In the future I would like to write a script using my lidar sensor to create an .obj file that displays a point cloud of some measured data. This could maybe be done using: https://www.matthewhaywood.co.uk/projects/dslr , with the DSLR camera swapped out with the LIDAR sensor. A rotary encoder could be used to get the x and y angle of the lidar sensor.

Was done following these instructions:
